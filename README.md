# EDA Tools Student Starter Pack

This is a template project to help students during their first steps with a plenty of EDA tools. 

- `/rtl` : The "main" hardware project; contains SystemVerilog and VHDL files. No tool-specific files.
- `/proto` : Files for using with the NexysA7 FPGA board; include constraints files and a "top" module. Ready for Vivado.
- `/sim` : Example of testbenches and scripts for using with Questa.
- `/synth` : Example of synthesis with Genus tool.
- `/lec` : Equivalence checking scripts for Conformal.
